                        <p>&quot;I can't thank you enough for all your help. The order was last minute and I appreciate your great customer service! The food was excellent, delivery was on time and the food was hot and ready to serve. We had several non-kosher people who always complain that kosher food is not very good, and they were all very impressed. The quality of the meat and the cooking was perfect and the fruit was ripe and delicious. I look forward to our next order!
